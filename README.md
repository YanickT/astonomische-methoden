# Astonomische Methoden (astronomical methods)
THE NETWORK DOES AT THE MOMENT NOT WORK

This project was created as part of the lecture 'Astronomische Methoden'.
The aim is to develop a simple neural network which predicts the redshift from the given bands.

The data were accessed using `astroquery.sdss`.

## Networks



## Data
The data used is from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) DR16. To obtain randomly sampled redshifts the data
is sorted by right ascension before choosing the amount of data sets to download from the top of the list. 
The object class is resticted depending for which network the training data is used for.
